activation function:
	Activation function is a mathematical function which decide whether to activate the given neuron or not based on certain threshold.
Activation function is used to counter the problems like exploding gradient. It is important to scale down the output values of the neuron in 
order to meet the convergence point early. Large output values of the neuron could cascade down through the network leading to both vanishing and exploding gradient 
problem.
